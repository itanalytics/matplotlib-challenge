## Description

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
  
  
## Final Analysis

1 duplicated mouse ID (g989) was found and removed from the study.  
  
Summary statistics show that mice treated with Capomulin had the second lowest average tumor volume.  
The lowest was with Ramicane. Both Capomulin and Ramicane had higher counts of total timepoints tested as well.   
  
The breakdown of sex was an almost even split,  51% male, 49% female.
In the data set of final tumor volumes for the top 4 drugs, only one outlier was found, and the drug regimen was Infubinol.  
  
A closer look at Mouse ID l509 treated with Capomulin showed a reduction in tumor volume over time.  
There is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume in mice treated with Capomulin, with lower weight correlating to lower average tumor volumes.
